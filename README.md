## Developer Comment

Hello everyone, and welcome back to my Repo! My name is Abdulhakeem Dahir and I am an aspiring Software Developer. This week I have been tasked to make a responsive online website. I am super excited to use my Week 2 skills to create this project. Any feedback is welcome! Thank you!

## Employer Request

An Employer is looking to hire a Web Developer for a Full Time or Part Time role. They are seeking someone who can showcase their talent and skillset by having a Live and Deployed Portfolio. The Portfolio itself must be responsive, and it must showcase all of the work that the applicant has done.

### User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
